The folder 'target_attack' mainly contains the following code:

1. Making changes to the function in "CascadingFailure.py".
(1) adding the argument (sum_centrality=None) to the function calculate_centrality_measures
(2) adding the argument (total_capacity=None) to the function calculate_capacity
By doing that we can scale the total load to the same value and generate the Result 1. Running code without scaling (seting both arguments=None) is also fine, so there should be no conflict with the original "CascadingFailure.py".

2. Adding the file "utils.py". This file contains all the functions used for running simulations multiple times, generating graphs, and saving the results to a .csv file. This is modified based on the version Jessie used in degree_distribution/main.py , so maybe I should make some changes if you want to merge these two files. 

3. Adding the file "target_attack_capacity.py". This is the file I used to run for the simulation and generate the data for results. 

4. Adding the file "random versus target.ipynb". This is written by Jessie so I think she will update the final version she used.

5. Adding the folder "csv_result". It contains the data used for generating graphs.
